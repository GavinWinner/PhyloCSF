BINARY DISTRIBUTION

Please see our web site for instructions on how to use this
software. This distribution includes executables for 32-bit Linux,
64-bit Linux, and 32-bit Mac OS X, as well as the parameter files
needed to run them.

PGP signatures for each executable by the maintainer (Mike Lin
<mlin@mlin.net>) are also included, detached in *.sig files. The
public key (D1AE42EA) can be obtained from:

http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xBA028A9FD1AE42EA
or
http://www.mlin.net/pgp

Of course, if you're concerned enough to verify the signatures, you'd
probably want to obtain the key some other way.
